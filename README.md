# What

A hosts file that helps students surf the net smoother, faster and safer in SYSU.

# Why

In Aug 2015, the main ISP of SYSU was replaced by CMCC, which has a heavily restricted "Internet": Speed (1.5 Mbps), Websites, etc. 

But luckily, we still have CHN-UNICOM and CERNET.
# How

This hosts file redirect those affected websites to their CERNET/CHN-UNICOM/IPv6 CDN, to bypass the limitation of CMCC.
